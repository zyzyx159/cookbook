<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 Cups bread flour, plus more for rolling *</li>
<li>1 Teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>1 Tablespoon yeast **</li>
<li>2 Teaspoons kosher salt</li>
<li>1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F</li>
<li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. Beat until the dough forms into a ball.
<ul>
<li>If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time</li>
<li>If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Knead the dough. I just leave the dough stirring until its ready.
<ul>
<li>To test of your dough is done kneading remove a small portion, flatten it, hold it up to a light and stretch in all four directions at the same time. If the dough stretches into spiderweb like lines its ready, if not keep kneading.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, Leave the dough to rise for one hour.
<ul>
<li>If the dough has not doubled in size, place it in a warmer environment and give it another 30 minutes.</li>
<li>I like to warm the oven up to 100 degrees and let the dough rise there.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Punch the dough down and let it rise until doubled again.</li>
<li>Stretch the on to a pizza pan(s)
<ul>
<li>For me this recipe makes 2 medium crusts or 1 large thick crust</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cook at 450 for 10 minutes.
<ul>
<li>I like a lot of toppings on my pizza and need to pre-cook the crust for 5-7 minutes before I add toppings, otherwise the crust is doughy in the middle.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>* Chef's Note: Using bread flour will give you a much crisper crust. If you can't find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.
** 2 1/4 Teaspoons is enough, but I don't want to wash the extra spoon</p>
