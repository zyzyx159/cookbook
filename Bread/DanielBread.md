# Daniel’s Bread

## Ingredients

-   1 Tablespoon bread machine (instant) yeast \*

-   2 3/4 cups warm water (110° to 115°)

-   3 Tablespoons sugar

-   1 Tablespoon salt

-   2 Tablespoons olive oil

-   6 Cups all-purpose flour

-   1/3 Cup ground flax seed

-   1/3 Cup hulled hep seeds

-   1/3 Cup chia seed

## Directions

1.  Mix ingredients. I just dump them all in the mixer and set it to stir.

2.  Continue to stir until the ingredients mix into a firm dough. The dough should be slightly sticky but pull into a ball preferring to stick to itself than the bowl.

3.  Knead the dough. I just leave the dough stirring until its ready.

    1.  To test of your dough is done kneading remove a small portion, flatten it, hold it up to a light and stretch in all four directions at the same time. If the dough stretches into spiderweb like lines its ready, if not keep kneading.

4.  Leave the dough to rise for one hour.

    1.  If the dough has not doubled in size, place it in a warmer environment and give it another 30 minutes.

    2.  I like to warm the oven up to 100 degrees and let the dough rise there.

5.  Punch the dough down.

6.  Divide it in half.

7.  Place in pre greased bread pans.

    1.  I have an oil sprayer I fill with olive oil.

8.  Leave the dough to rise for one hour.

    1.  See the notes on step 4, repeat them.

9.  Bake at 375° for 30-35 minutes.

10. While its cooling rub the top of the loaf with butter and cool in the pan.

11. I only use real butter, not margarine.

\* one package of yeast is 1/4 ounce or 2 1/4 teaspoons, but I use a tablespoon because I don’t want to dirty more dishes and the result is the same.
