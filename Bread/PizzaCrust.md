# Pizza Crust

## Ingredients

- 4 Cups bread flour, plus more for rolling \*
- 1 Teaspoon sugar
- 1 Tablespoon yeast \*\*
- 2 Teaspoons kosher salt
- 1 1/2 cups water, 110 degrees F
- 2 Tablespoons olive oil

## Directions

1. Combine all ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine. Beat until the dough forms into a ball.
   - If the dough is sticky, add additional flour, 1 tablespoon at a time
   - If the dough is too dry, add additional water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
2. Knead the dough. I just leave the dough stirring until its ready.
   - To test of your dough is done kneading remove a small portion, flatten it, hold it up to a light and stretch in all four directions at the same time. If the dough stretches into spiderweb like lines its ready, if not keep kneading.
3. Grease a large bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons olive oil, Leave the dough to rise for one hour.
   - If the dough has not doubled in size, place it in a warmer environment and give it another 30 minutes.
   - I like to warm the oven up to 100 degrees and let the dough rise there.
4. Punch the dough down and let it rise until doubled again.
5. Stretch the on to a pizza pan(s)
   - For me this recipe makes 2 medium crusts or 1 large thick crust
6. Cook at 450 for 10 minutes.
   - I like a lot of toppings on my pizza and need to pre-cook the crust for 5-7 minutes before I add toppings, otherwise the crust is doughy in the middle.

\* Chef's Note: Using bread flour will give you a much crisper crust. If you can't find bread flour, you can substitute it with all-purpose flour which will give you a chewier crust.
\*\* 2 1/4 Teaspoons is enough, but I don't want to wash the extra spoon
