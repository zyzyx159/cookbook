# Hard Candy

## Ingredients

-   2 Cups white sugar

-   2/3 cup light corn syrup

-   3/4 cups water

-   1 Teaspoon liquid flavor

-   Food coloring (optional)

## Directions

1.  Combine all ingredients in a medium saucepan over a medium heat.

2.  Stir the mixture until all sugar is dissolved.

    1.  Too much stirring will ruin the mixture.

    2.  Once it starts bubbling the bubbles will do the stirring.

3.  Once the mixture has reached 260 degrees add the food coloring.

    1.  While the mixture is heating up it will stop at 200 for a while.

    2.  The mixture is evaporating all the water; the temperature will not rise until all the water is gone.

4.  Once the mixture as reached 300 degrees remove from the heat.

5.  Let the mixture cool until it stops bubbling.

6.  Add the flavor and stir it.

7.  Pour the mixture into molds of drops on a sheet of wax paper.

## Notes

Melted sugar is extremely dangerous. The sugar is 300 degrees and extremely sticky. If you touch it run the affected area under cool water for 10-15 minutes, if burning sensation persists seek medical attention.
