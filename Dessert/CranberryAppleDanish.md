# Cranberry Apple Danish

## Ingredients

- 3 Tablespoons sugar
- 1/4 Teaspoon cinnamon
- 1 Egg
- 1 Apple; peeled, quartered and cored
- 2 Sheets store-bought puff pastry
- 1 Cup cranberry sauce
- 1 egg, lightly beaten

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
2. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
3. In a small bowl, stir the sugar and cinnamon together to combine.
4. In another small bowl, whisk the egg with 2 tablespoons water to combine.
5. Starting at one of the short ends, slice each apple quarter into thin slices.
6. Roll out a sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to flatten it just a bit.
7. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into six 3-inch squares.
8. Transfer the squares to a prepared baking sheet.
9. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry, and transfer the squares to the other prepared baking sheet.
10. Working one at a time, fold the corners of each square inward so they meet at the center.
11. Press the center lightly with your thumb to seal and make an indent.
12. Spoon 1 rounded tablespoon of the cranberry sauce into the center of each square.
13. Top each with 5 to 7 slices of apple.
14. Brush the exposed edges of puff pastry with the egg wash (it helps the pastry get golden brown).
15. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the apples.
16. Bake the pastries until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.
17. Let cool slightly before serving.
