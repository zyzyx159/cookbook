# Over loaded chocolate chip cookies

## Ingredients

- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup light brown sugar
- 1/2 Teaspoon salt
- 1 Teaspoon baking soda
- 1 Cup (2 sticks) butter
- 2 1/4 Cups all-purpose flour
- 1 Teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 Large eggs
- 2 Cup (12 oz, one bag) dark chocolate chips
- 1-1/3 Cup (9 oz, one bag) Heath English Toffee Bits
- 1 Cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Melt butter.
3. Add sugar, brown sugar, salt, baking soda, vanilla, butter, and eggs.
    - Stir well.
4. Stir in flour.
   - If you are doing this by hand or hand mixer stir in flour 3/4 cup at a time.
5. Now add the chips, toffee and optional nuts, again mix well.
       - I call them 'overload' for a reason. If done right you should be worried that there is not enough dough to hold the chips, toffee and nuts together.
6. Drop by rounded teaspoons on an ungreased cookie sheet.
7. Bakes in 8-10 minutes or until golden brown.
8. Remove from cookie sheet and cool on a wire rack.
