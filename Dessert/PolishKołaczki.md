# Polish Kołaczki

## Ingredients

-   8 Ounce cream cheese, softened

-   3 Sticks butter, softened

-   3 Cups all-purpose flour

-   28 ounces of fillings of your choice (apricot, prune, raspberry, etc.)

-   Confectioners' sugar

## Directions

1.  Mix softened cream cheese and softened butter until light and fluffy.

2.  Add all-purpose flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix well.

3.  Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

4.  Heat oven to 350 degrees.

5.  Roll out dough 1/4 inch thick on a surface that has been dusted with equal parts confectioners' and granulated sugars (not flour), because the granulated sugar will act as ball bearings and help keep the dough from sticking.

6.  Cut into 2-inch squares.

7.  Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon filling on center of each square.

8.  Overlap opposite corners of dough to the center over filling.

9.  Bake for 15 minutes (longer if baking frozen) or when corners start to brown.

10. Cool completely and dust with confectioners’ sugar.

## Notes

-   Dust with confectioners sugar just prior to service.

-   These tend to become soggy if held for several days, so store them tightly covered (or freeze) without the confectioners' sugar.

-   You can freeze the fillings with little loss in flavor or consistency.

-   You can freeze kołaczki filled and unbaked and bake them from the frozen state.

-   Don’t freeze baked kołaczki because when you defrost them, they will become soggy.
