== Cranberry Apple Danish

=== Ingredients

* 3 Tablespoons sugar
* 1/4 Teaspoon cinnamon
* 1 Egg
* 1 Apple; peeled, quartered and cored
* 2 Sheets store-bought puff pastry
* 1 Cup cranberry sauce
* 1 egg, lightly beaten

=== Directions

. Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.
. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
. In a small bowl, stir the sugar and cinnamon together to combine.
. In another small bowl, whisk the egg with 2 tablespoons water to combine.
. Starting at one of the short ends, slice each apple quarter into thin slices.
. Roll out a sheet of puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to flatten it just a bit.
. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut the pastry into six 3-inch squares.
. Transfer the squares to a prepared baking sheet.
. Repeat with the second sheet of puff pastry, and transfer the squares to the other prepared baking sheet.
. Working one at a time, fold the corners of each square inward so they meet at the center.
. Press the center lightly with your thumb to seal and make an indent.
. Spoon 1 rounded tablespoon of the cranberry sauce into the center of each square.
. Top each with 5 to 7 slices of apple.
. Brush the exposed edges of puff pastry with the egg wash (it helps the pastry get golden brown).
. Sprinkle 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon-sugar mixture over the apples.
. Bake the pastries until golden brown, 15 to 18 minutes.
. Let cool slightly before serving.
