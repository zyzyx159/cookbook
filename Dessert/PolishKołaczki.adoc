== Polish Kołaczki

=== Ingredients

* 8 Ounce cream cheese, softened
* 3 Sticks butter, softened
* 3 Cups all-purpose flour
* 28 ounces of fillings of your choice (apricot, prune, raspberry, etc.)
* Confectioners' sugar

=== Directions

. Mix softened cream cheese and softened butter until light and fluffy.
. Add all-purpose flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix well.
. Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
. Roll out dough 1/4 inch thick on a surface that has been dusted with equal parts confectioners' and granulated sugars (not flour), because the granulated sugar will act as ball bearings and help keep the dough from sticking.
. Cut into 2-inch squares.
. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon filling on center of each square.
. Overlap opposite corners of dough to the center over filling.
. Bake for 15 minutes (longer if baking frozen) or when corners start to brown.
. Cool completely and dust with confectioners’ sugar.

=== Notes

* Dust with confectioners sugar just prior to service.
* These tend to become soggy if held for several days, so store them tightly covered (or freeze) without the confectioners' sugar.
* You can freeze the fillings with little loss in flavor or consistency.
* You can freeze kołaczki filled and unbaked and bake them from the frozen state.
* Don't freeze baked kołaczki because when you defrost them, they will become soggy.
