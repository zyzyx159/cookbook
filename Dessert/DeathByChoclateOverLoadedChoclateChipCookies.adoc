== Death by Chocolate Over loaded chocolate chip cookies

=== Ingredients

* 2 1/4 Cups all-purpose flour
* 3/4 Cup granulated sugar
* 3/4 Cup light brown sugarS
* 1/3 Cup cocoa
* 1/2 Teaspoon salt
* 1 Teaspoon baking soda
* 1 Cup (2 sticks) butter
* 1 Teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 Large eggs
* 2 Cup (12 oz, one bag) dark chocolate chips
* 1 1/3 Cup (9 oz, one bag) Heath English Toffee Bits
* 1 Cup chopped walnuts (optional)

=== Directions

. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
. Melt butter and let cool.
. Mix sugar, brown sugar, Cocoa, salt, baking soda, vanilla, butter, and eggs.
. Stir in flour.
   .. If you are doing this by hand or hand mixer stir in flour 3/4 cup at a time.
. Now add the chips, toffee and optional nuts, again mix well.
   .. I call them 'overload' for a reason. If done right you should be worried that there is not enough dough to hold the chips, toffee and nuts together.
. Drop by rounded teaspoons on an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten them.
. Bakes in 10-12 minutes.
. Give the cookies a few minutes to cool and harden, they don't harden in the oven.
. Remove from cookie sheet and cool on a wire rack.
