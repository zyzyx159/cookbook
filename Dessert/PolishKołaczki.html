<ul>
<li>8 Ounce cream cheese, softened</li>
<li>3 Sticks butter, softened</li>
<li>3 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li>28 ounces of fillings of your choice (apricot, prune, raspberry, etc.)</li>
<li>Confectioners' sugar</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mix softened cream cheese and softened butter until light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Add all-purpose flour, 1 cup at a time, and mix well.</li>
<li>Wrap dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
<li>Heat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
<li>Roll out dough 1/4 inch thick on a surface that has been dusted with equal parts confectioners' and granulated sugars (not flour), because the granulated sugar will act as ball bearings and help keep the dough from sticking.</li>
<li>Cut into 2-inch squares.</li>
<li>Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon filling on center of each square.</li>
<li>Overlap opposite corners of dough to the center over filling.</li>
<li>Bake for 15 minutes (longer if baking frozen) or when corners start to brown.</li>
<li>Cool completely and dust with confectioners’ sugar.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dust with confectioners sugar just prior to service.</li>
<li>These tend to become soggy if held for several days, so store them tightly covered (or freeze) without the confectioners' sugar.</li>
<li>You can freeze the fillings with little loss in flavor or consistency.</li>
<li>You can freeze kołaczki filled and unbaked and bake them from the frozen state.</li>
<li>Don't freeze baked kołaczki because when you defrost them, they will become soggy.</li>
</ul>
