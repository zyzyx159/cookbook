# Death by Chocolate Over loaded chocolate chip cookies

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 Cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 Cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 Cup light brown sugar
- 1/3 Cup cocoa
- 1/2 Teaspoon salt
- 1 Teaspoon baking soda
- 1 Cup (2 sticks) butter
- 1 Teaspoon vanilla extract
- 2 Large eggs
- 2 Cup (12 oz, one bag) dark chocolate chips
- 1 1/3 Cup (9 oz, one bag) Heath English Toffee Bits
- 1 Cup chopped walnuts (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Melt butter and let cool.
3. Mix sugar, brown sugar, Cocoa, salt, baking soda, vanilla, butter, and eggs.
4. Stir in flour.
   - If you are doing this by hand or hand mixer stir in flour 3/4 cup at a time.
5. Now add the chips, toffee and optional nuts, again mix well.
   - I call them 'overload' for a reason. If done right you should be worried that there is not enough dough to hold the chips, toffee and nuts together.
6. Drop by rounded teaspoons on an ungreased cookie sheet and flatten them.
7. Bakes in 10-12 minutes.
8. Give the cookies a few minutes to cool and harden, they don't harden in the oven.
9. Remove from cookie sheet and cool on a wire rack.
