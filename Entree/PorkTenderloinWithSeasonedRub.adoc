== Pork Tenderloin With Seasoned Rub

=== Ingredients

* 1 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* Salt
* 1 1/4 pounds pork tenderloin
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 teaspoon minced garlic

=== Directions

. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.
. In separate bowl mix dry ingredients such as garlic powder, oregano, cumin, coriander, thyme and salt.
. Stir mixture with a fork until all the ingredients are well combined and they form a seasoning.
. This will be used as a rub to ensure the pork is well seasoned throughout.
. Sprinkle the rub over the tenderloin with a dry hand, then rub the pork with the seasoning over both sides of the meat, pressing gently so the seasoning adheres well to the tenderloin.
. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and heat.
. Add the minced garlic and saute, stirring, for 1 minute.
. Put tenderloin in the pan and cook for about 10 minutes, searing each side using tongs to turn the meat.
. Transfer meat to a roasting pan and bake for 20 minutes. Slice and serve.
