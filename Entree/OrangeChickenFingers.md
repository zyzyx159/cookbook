- 1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet and lightly mist with nonstick cooking spray.
2. Put the sesame seeds in a small nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Cook, stirring often, until golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes.
3. Set aside to cool.
4. Put the cereal in a plastic storage bag and crush with a rolling pin or heavy can until coarsely crushed.
5. In a shallow bowl combine the toasted sesame seeds, crushed cereal and orange zest and lightly season with salt and pepper.
6. In a second shallow dish, beat the egg whites with the teriyaki sauce.
7. Dip each chicken tender in the egg mixture and then the cereal mixture, pressing to coat well.
8. Place on the rack and mist the chicken with nonstick cooking spray.
9. Bake until the crust is golden and the chicken is cooked through, 18 to 20 minutes.
10. Meanwhile, in a small sauce pot heat the marmalade, teriyaki and ginger over medium heat until melted and well combined.
11. Remove from heat and stir in the lemon juice.
