== Herb Marinated Pork Tenderloins

=== Ingredients

* 1 lemon, zest grated
* 3/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (4 to 6 lemons)
* Good olive oil
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic (6 cloves)
* 1 & 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary leaves
* 1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme leaves
* 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard
* Kosher salt
* 3 pork tenderloins (about 1 pound each)

=== Directions

. Combine the lemon zest, lemon juice, 1/2 cup olive oil, garlic, rosemary, thyme, mustard, and 2 teaspoons salt in a sturdy 1-gallon resealable plastic bag.
. Add the pork tenderloins and turn to coat with the marinade.
. Squeeze out the air and seal the bag.
. Marinate the pork in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours but preferably overnight.
. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
. Remove the tenderloins from the marinade and discard the marinade but leave the herbs that cling to the meat.
. Sprinkle the tenderloins generously with salt.
. Heat 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large oven-proof saute pan over medium-high heat.
. Sear the pork tenderloins on all sides until golden brown.
. Place the saute pan in the oven and roast the tenderloins for 10 to 15 minutes or until the meat registers 137 degrees F at the thickest part.
. Transfer the tenderloins to a platter and cover tightly with aluminum foil.
. Allow to rest for 10 minutes.
. Carve in 1/2-inch-thick diagonal slices.
. The thickest part of the tenderloin will be quite pink (it's just fine!) and the thinnest part will be well done.
. Season with salt and serve warm, or at room temperature with the juices that collect in the platter.
