== Spicy Kale and Corn Stuffed Chicken Breasts

=== Ingredients

* 4 teaspoons olive oil
* 5 & 1/2 ounces frozen chopped kale (about 2 cups)
* Cloves garlic, finely chopped
* Kosher salt
* 1/3 cup frozen whole kernel corn
* 2 ounces pepper jack cheese, grated (about 1/2 cup)
* Four 8-ounce boneless skinless chicken breast halves
* 1/2 cup low-sodium chicken broth
* 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour
* 1 & 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice

=== Directions

. Heat 2 teaspoons of the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
. Add the kale, garlic and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook, stirring, until the kale is softened and the garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes.
. Add the corn and cook, stirring, until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes more.
. Transfer to a bowl to cool slightly, and then stir in the cheese.
. Insert a thin paring knife into the thickest part of the chicken breast and cut down the side to make a 3-inch pocket.
. Repeat with the remaining chicken breasts.
. Then evenly stuff with the kale mixture.
. Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until very hot, 3 to 4 minutes.
. Rub the chicken breasts with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and sprinkle with a total of 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
. Add all 4 chicken breasts to the skillet and cook until golden brown, about 2 minutes.
. Then lower heat to medium.
. Continue cooking, turning once halfway through, until just cooked through, about 14 minutes more.
. Insert a small paring knife into the top of the chicken to test for doneness.
. If any pink areas remain, cover the skillet and continue to cook until opaque.
. Transfer the chicken and any bits of filling that fell into the skillet onto 4 plates.
. Stir the broth and flour together in a small bowl and then add to the skillet.
. Cook, stirring, until thickened, about 2 minutes.
. Remove from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.
. Spoon the pan sauce over the chicken.
